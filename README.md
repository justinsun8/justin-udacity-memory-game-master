# Matching Cards Game

The game begins when the first move is made. When a card is clicked, a timer begins. Once the game is complete the timer will end. Any number of moves can be made, however - if you make too many mistakes, the stars will be removed one by one.

## How to Play

Make moves on the table of cards by choosing pairs of cards that you think that have the same symbols. If the cards match, they will remain open. If they do not match, they will flip over and you can try again.



## Game Behavior

-The game randomly shuffles the cards. Player wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

-When a player wins the game, a modal appears to detail the statistics and gives the user an option to either cancel or replay.

-A restart button allows the player to reset the game board at any time of the game: the timer, and the star rating.

-The game displays a star rating (from 1-3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display 3 stars. After some number of moves, it should change to a 2 star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a 1 star rating. The number of moves needed to change the rating is at 15 moves, and 30 moves.

-When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.

-Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.
